# Customer-Data-Project
### Project Title: Customer Data Analysis
### Project Overview
This data analysis project focuses on uncovering insights for sales performance. Through careful analysis of key data metrics, we aim to gain valuable information that drives strategic decision-making. By identifying patterns and top-performing areas, weâ€™ll create a clear narrative around the data, turning insights into actionable stories for enhanced understanding and results.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset for this analysis, Data_sales.csv, is an open-source file exclusively available for download to members of the Ladies in Tech Africa group. It can be accessed through various online platforms and open data repositories.

### Tools and Method Used
- Microsoft Excel  The Data was analysis using Microsoft Excel, utilizing pivot table to organize, summarize , and filter the Data for easier interpretation [Download Here](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/10186984/files/folder/Capstone%20Project)
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- Power BI - For Visualization
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Project Objective
This project was designed to address the following Analysis goals;

1. Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month
2. Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.
3. Create any other interesting report
4. Retrieve the total sales for each product category.
5. Find the number of sales transactions in each region.
6. Find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
7. Calculate total revenue per product.
8. Calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
9. Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
10. Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
